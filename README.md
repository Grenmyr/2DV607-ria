Runnable version of my helloWorld [app]: (http://grenmyr.github.io/HelloWorldReact/)    
And repository is here: [app:master](https://github.com/Grenmyr/HelloWorldReact/tree/master)

## Main project
####Unfortunatly my material design style framework bugs atm, so the runnable version on gh-pages behaves badly.
If you just want to take a look on application i recommend clone it.

Then 
1: navigate to root:
2: npm install
3: npm run start
4: open browser localhost:8080

#### Feel free to contribute if you like!
Then fork repo and submit a pullrequest when done with changes.
1: navigate to root:
2: npm install
3: npm run start
4: open browser localhost:8080
